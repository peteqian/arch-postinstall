# Arch Postinstall

Just a quick way to maintain the packages I use and download in the event I break my system.

Use at your own risk.

Please refer to [typecraft's](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) [Crucible](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/crucible) as I used this to bootstrap my post-install. It's an amazingly simple way to get started quickly.
